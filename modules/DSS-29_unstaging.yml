        - do: "Type `echo \"This is my file to unstage.\" > unstageme.md`"
          say: "Let's set up another scenario. First we will create a file called unstageme.md."
        - do: "Type `git add unstageme.md`"
          say: "Then we will stage it for the next commit. Occassionally we run into a scenario where we are trying to craft our commits and accidentally end up with a file in the staging area that we do not want to include in the next commit. "
        - do: "Type `git reset HEAD unstageme.md`"
          say: "In this case, git is helpful and tells us how to remove the file from the staging area. We simply type git reset HEAD and then the file name."
        - do: "Type `git status`"
          say: "This unstages the file and moves it back to our working directory. From there, we can make additional changes to the file or simply add it to the next commit."
