        - do: Navigate to the `class repository`
          say: "In addition to Issues and Pull Requests, GitHub provides many of the social features you would expect from a collaboration platform. Let's take a look at a few of these features now."
        - do: Click `Watch`
          say: "Watching a repository allows you to stay up to date on what is happening within that project. When you choose to watch a repository, you will receive a notification when a new issue, pull request or comment is added to the repository. You will also be notified when issues are closed and pull requests are merged."
        - do: Show `Not Watching`
          say: If you do not want to receive notifications for every action in the repository, you can choose the not watching option. But don't worry, you will still receive notifications if you are @ mentioned individually or as part of a group. You will also receive notifications if you comment on a specific conversation.
        - do: Show `Ignoring`
          say: The other option is to ignore a repository. Choose this option if you never want to get notifications from this repository.
        - do: Click `User Settings > Notifications`
          say: "In addition to watching or ignoring a repository, you can use your notification settings to control the number of notifications you receive."
        - do: Show email vs. web options for notifications
          say: "You can choose whether to receive notifications via email or online."
        - do: Click the `notification` icon
          say: "When you choose web notifications, you will receive your notifications through the web interface."
        - do: Click `watching`
          say: "If you are receiving too many notifications, you can use the watching tab to review all of the repositories you are currently watching and easily unwatch those you would like to stop receiving."
        - do: Click `Star`
          say: "Starring a repository adds it to a special list of favorite repositories. If you are just interested in a project and want to find it easily again, you should star it. You will not receive notifications about starred projects. These are more like bookmarks that make these projects easy to find."
        - do: Click `Explore`
          say: "The explore option can help you find projects on GitHub. Use these options to explore the full range of what GitHub has to offer - or maybe even find an interesting open source project to work on!"

        * Watching a repository means that you will get frequent updates about the repository. 
          * When Issues, Pull Requests, or Comments are added to the repository.
          * When Issues are closed and Pull Requests are merged.
        * Not watching a repository means that you will only be notified when your GitHub username is @mentioned, or when conversations that you've already commented on are updated.
        * Ignoring a repository means that you will receive no notification, even when you're @mentioned.
        * You can set what type of notifications you want to receive in your account's notification settings.
        * You can see all of the repositories you are currently watching, and unwatch any of them, in the Watching tab.
        * Staring a repository puts it in a special list of repositories. You won't receive notifications on them, it just makes them easier to find later.
        * The Explore option lets you easily find public repositories on GitHub.
