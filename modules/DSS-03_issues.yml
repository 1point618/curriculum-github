      presenter-script: |
        Use GitHub issues to record and discuss ideas, enhancements, tasks, and bugs. They make collaboration easier in a variety of ways, such as:

        * Replacing email for project discussions, ensuring everyone on the team has the complete story.
        * Allowing you to cross-link to other issues and pull requests.
        * Creating a single, comprehensive record of how and why you made certain decisions.
        * Allowing you to easily pull the right people into a conversation.

      title: Using Issues
      video: https://youtu.be/Zhj46r5D0nQ
      video-script:
        - do: Navigate to the `class repository`
          say: Let's dive a little deeper into Issues.
        - do: "Navigate to the issue `Class Goals`"
          say: Here, I will create an issue titled Class Goals. Let's look at some of the special features in issues that you will use to collaborate with your team.
        - do: Add an issue comment demonstrating Markdown formatting for headers, bullets and checkboxes.
          say: GitHub uses a syntax called Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to issues.
        - do: "@mention any co-teachers"
          say: One of our favorite features is the @mention. When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.
        - do: Click `Preview`
          say: You can use the preview tab to see how your comment will be rendered (meaning how GitHub will actually display your Markdown file).
        - do: Include an issue attachment
          say: You can also add pictures by simply dragging and dropping them into the comment field, or clicking the file uploader link.
        - do: Click `Comment`
          say: Click the green comment button to add your comments to the discussion.
        - do: Return to the `Issues` view
          say: As you can imagine, a large project can have hundreds of issues. Let's look at a few ways your project team can organize issues.
        - do: "`Assign` the issue to the co-teacher"
          say: First, you can assign issues to anyone with access to the repo. Typically, this will be the person who is currently responsible for the next step in the life of the issue. The issue assignee may change over time.
        - do: Add a `label` to the issue
          say: You can also use labels to help you organize issues. GitHub comes with a number of built-in labels, but you can always delete those or add your own. As a project grows in size, using assignees and labels makes it much easier to find a specific issue.
        - do: "Click `Issues > Filters`"
          say: Filters allow you to easily search for Issues by creator, labels, assignees and more. We will continue to explore these features throughout the course. For now, let's practice creating an issue!

        * You can use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/" target="_blank">Markdown</a> to format issues.
        * You can `@mention` somebody in order to alert them of the issue.
        * The "Preview" tab shows how your comment will be rendered.
        * Add screenshots or pictures to the issue by simply dragging and dropping them into the comment field.
        * You can assign an issue to anyone with access to the repo.
        * Labels can be used to organize issues.
        * You can filter issues by label, author or assignee.

        - Let's practice creating issues now!
      introduction: |
        Follow the steps below in your GitHub class repository (available from the "Repository" link above). We'll let you know when you completed each action correctly. The names and contents of the actions are just suggestions, but we'll refer to them in future labs so even though we don't validate the details, we do suggest you use the same naming schemes that we do.
      steps:
        - description: "Create an Issue to add your bio to the repo. The issue should contain each of the following: your name, the information about your from Issue #3, a request to add your bio, and some markdown formatting to make it all look pretty. This way the information is there for whoever ends up fixing the issue (spoiler alert, in this case that's going to be you)."
          id: DSS-03-create-issue
          verifications:
            - verification-type: issue-created
              id: DSS-03-create-issue-verification
              success-message: "Great job - you created an issue."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't created an issue yet."
        - description: Assign the issue you just created to yourself
          id: DSS-03-assign-issue
          verifications:
            - verification-type: issue-assigned-to-self
              id: DSS-03-assign-issue-verification
              success-message: "Great job - you assigned the issue to yourself."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't assigned the issue to yourself yet."
        - description: Apply the label of "bio" to the issue.
          id: DSS-03-label-issue
          verifications:
            - verification-type: issue-labeled
              id: DSS-03-label-issue-verification
              success-message: "Great job - you applied a label to the issue. If it was the \"bio\" label, then on to the next slide now."
              failure-message: "It looks like you haven't applied the 'bio' label to the issue yet."
