        This course is designed to walk you through the version control and collaboration features of GitHub and Git. You'll be reading text and watching videos about git and GitHub, and we'll be asking you to perform all the actions we show you in your own GitHub repository. You'll have the chance to practice everything you learn.

        For now, click on the "next" button above to move onto the second slide.

      title: What is GitHub?
      image: github-icon.jpg
      presenter-script: |
        GitHub is a project collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git. GitHub and Git help teams work together on a project easily.

        With Git, each person has a local copy of the project to work on. As they make changes locally, they upload them to the central cloud copy, then download the changes that others have made.

        GitHub provides this central copy of the code, as well as a number of features that make collaborating on that copy easier.

      title: Key GitHub Features

      presenter-script:
        - In addition to being a place to host and share your Git projects, GitHub provides a number of features to help your team collaborate. These include "issues" for discussing features and bugs with your teammates and "pull requests" for discussing and reviewing new features your team is working on.

      presenter-script: |
        You can also use all of your favorite tools and development processes with GitHub. GitHub doesn't require a new text editor, command lind shell, or bug tracker: your team gets to keep the tools they're comfortable with.

        GitHub can also integrate into your current deployment process, and fully supports continuous integration and continuous deployment to help you and your team build software better, together.
