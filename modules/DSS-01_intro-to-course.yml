      title: What is GitHub?
      image: github-icon.jpg
      presenter-script: |
        GitHub is a project collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git.

        GitHub and git help teams work together on a project easily.

        With Git, each person has a local copy of the project, and as they make changes there they upload them to the central cloud copy, then download the changes that others have made.
