        This course will teach you how to use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. Learning both requires practice, so this will be a hands-on course. Each of the exercises will be done in your own GitHub repository.

        Click the "next" button above to get started.

        GitHub is a website that allows your team to collaborate more effectively. It is built on top of Gitâ€”a distributed version control system. GitHub and Git help teams to collaborate more effectively on projects.

        With Git, each person has a local copy of the project to work on. As they make changes locally, they can upload them to GitHub and download any changes that others have made.

        In addition to being a place to host and share your Git projects, GitHub provides features that make collaborating easier.

        * The **Code View** lets you see your project directory and code, as well as its history.
        * **Issues** are general places for discussions about the project, from high-level planning to bug tracking. 
        * **Pull Requests** let you discuss and review specific changes to the project files themselves.
        * The **Pulse** gives you a high-level overview of how the project is proceding.
        * You can use the **Wiki** to add documentation to your project, although most people just use markdown files in the repository.
        * **Graphs** tell you who has been contributing what, when, to your project.

        In this course we'll heavily focus on the first three features, but once you're done feel free to experiment with the others!

        You can also use all of your favorite tools with GitHub. You don't need to use a new text editor or bug tracker: your team gets to keep the tools they're comfortable with.

        GitHub can also integrate into your current deployment process, and fully supports continuous integration and continuous deployment to help you and your team build software better, together.

        For more information on integrating GitHub with the tools you already use, refer to <a href="https://github.com/integrations" target="_blank">GitHub's Integrations page</a>.
