        This course is designed to walk you through best practices on using Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration. You'll be reading text and watching videos about Git and GitHub, and we'll be asking you to perform all the actions we show you in your own GitHub repository. You'll have the chance to practice everything you learn.

        For now, click on the "next" button above to move onto the next slide.

        There are also labs where you'll be asked to complete tasks on GitHub. We'll automatically know when you've completed the tasks, so there's no need to submit anything.

      title: What is GitHub?
      image: github-icon.jpg
      presenter-script: |
        GitHub is a website that allows your team to collaborate more effectively. It is built on top of Gitâ€”a distributed version control system. GitHub and Git help teams to collaborate more effectively on projects.

        With Git, each person has a local copy of the project to work on. As they make changes locally, they upload them to GitHub after downloading any changes that others have made.

        GitHub provides access to a central copy of the code, as well as features like Pull Requests and Issues that make collaborating easier.

      title: Key GitHub Features

      presenter-script:
        - In addition to being a place to host and share your Git projects, GitHub provides a number of features to help your team collaborate. These include Issues for discussing features and bugs with your teammates and Pull Requests for discussing and reviewing new features your team is working on.

        You can also use all of your favorite tools and development processes with GitHub. GitHub doesn't require a new text editor, command line shell, or bug tracker: your team gets to keep the tools they're comfortable with.

        GitHub can also integrate into your current deployment process, and fully supports continuous integration and continuous deployment to help you and your team build software better, together.

        For more information on integrating GitHub with the tools you already use, refer to <a href="https://github.com/integrations" target="_blank">GitHub's Integrations page</a>.
