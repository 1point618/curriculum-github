        Frequently, collaborators will make changes to our files during the Pull Request process. Before we can go on, we will need to update our local copy of the file.
        
        We use push to send our changes to the remote, but we use pull to retrieve changes from the remote. When we pull the files from the remote git downloads a copy of the new commits that have been added to the branch since our last pull and then attempts to merge them into our local branch.

          say: "Let's go back to our terminal window."
        - do: "Type `git checkout master`"
          say: "Since our changes have already been merged to master on the remote, let's go ahead and checkout to our master branch."
        - do: "Type `git pull`"
          say: "Now we will type git pull. Git already knows that our local branch master is related to the remote branch master, so we do not need to tell git where to pull from."
        - do: "Show output"
          say: "After the pull is complete, git provides a report of the changes that were pulled from the remote and lets us know they were successfully merged."
        - do: "Type `git branch`"
          say: "You will notice that, even though you deleted the branch on GitHub, the local copy of your branch still exists."
        - do: "Type `git branch --merged`"
          say: "To see which local branches have already been merged into master, you can add the --merged option to the git branch command. Your branch should be listed. Generally, this means it is safe to delete the branch."
        - do: "Type `git branch -d <branch-name>`"
          say: "To delete the branch, simply use the git branch command with the -d option."

        * When the remote repository has been changed (such as after a pull request), you need to update your local repository manually.
        * The command `git pull` will make your local working branch up to date with the remote version of that same branch. 
        * This will not delete local branches that have been deleted on the remote repo. 
        * To delete local branches that do not have a remote counterpart, use the `git branch --merged` command to list all such local branches, and then `git branch -d BRANCH_NAME` to delete specific local branches.
