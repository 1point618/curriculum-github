        - do: "Type git log --stat"
          say: "Let's take a look at the history you just created. You should have at least two commits to the same file."
        - do: "Copy the first 7 characters of the most recent commit ID"
          say: "Let's say that you made a mistake and need to undo all of the changes from the last commit. First you will need to find the commit and copy the first few characters of the SHA-1. You generally only need a few characters."
        - do: "Type git revert <commit ID>"
          say: "Now you will type git revert and paste in the SHA-1 you copied. Git will create a new commit that is the exact opposite of the commit you are reverting."
        - do: "Edit the commit message"
          say: "Your default text editor will open so you can edit the commit message."
        - do: "Click Save > Close"
          say: "Simply save it and close the text editor to complete the process."
