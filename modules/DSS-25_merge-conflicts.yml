          say: "Now that you have created a merge conflict, let's learn how to fix it using a simple text editor. First we will type git status and look for a section called unmerged paths. This tells us which files are creating the merge conflict."
        - do: "Type `atom conflict.md`"
          say: "Open the file in your text editor."
        - do: "Show the merge conflict markers"
          say: "First you will see a bunch of less than signs with the marker HEAD. Then you will see a chunk of content separated by a row of equal signs. Below the chunk of content, you will see a bunch of greater than signs with the marker merge-me. This is the text that is causing the conflict. The text above the equal signs is what is found in the checked out branch (in this case our master branch). And the text below the equal signs is what is found in the branch we are trying to merge."
        - do: "Delete text to clear the conflict"
          say: "We simply need to decide which text we want to keep."
        - do: "Delete the conflict markers"
          say: "Then delete the conflict markers."
        - do: "Click `Save > Quit`"
          say: "Save our file and then close our text editor."
        - do: "Type `git status`"
          say: "Now when we type git status, it will show us that we are still in the middle of a merge and we have a file ready to be committed."
        - do: "Type `git add conflict.md`"
          say: "Simply add the conflict file to the staging area."
        - do: "Type `git commit -m\"fix merge conflict\"`"
          say: "And commit the file to complete the merge."

        * When you have a merge conflict, type `git status` and look for "unmerged paths" to see which files are creating the merge conflict.
        * Open the file in your text editor. You will see some lines that look like the following:
              <<<<<<<< HEAD
              Some text here.
              ========
              Different text here.
              >>>>>>>> merge-me
        * The text above and below the equal signs are what is causing the merge conflict. They appear on the same line but are different text.
        * Decide how you want to resolve the conflict, and once that's completed delete the merge markers. Save and close your text editor.
        * `git status` will show that the files are no longer in conflict, but that you are in the middle of a merge. `git add` the file and then `git commit` it, and the merge will then automatically complete.
