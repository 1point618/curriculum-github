      title: Using GitHub Locally

        GitHub.com is great when you want to work on a central copy of the code, but for making big changes it's better to do the work locally, on your own computer. Git, the version control system that GitHub is built on, makes it easy to work on local files then push them up to your central GitHub repository. However, Git is a command line tool, and takes a lot of time to learn.

        Happily, GitHub provides a graphical user interface for Git, called GitHub Desktop. This tool lets you manage your repositories locally, and push changes up to the central GitHub repository only when you choose to. You can use whatever local tools you want to edit files. 

        One thing to note is that GitHub Desktop only works on Mac and PCs. If you use Linux or another desktop operating system, you'll have to learn how to use Git on the command line.

        Let's download and install GitHub Desktop now. The next page will walk you through the steps to do thisâ€”make sure to complete them all before moving on.
