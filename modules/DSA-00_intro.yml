      presenter-script: |
        This assessment will be used to get a sense for how much you learned from the GitHub class.

        Go through the following slides, answering each question to the best of your ability. You won't be able to re-submit your answers once you've hit submit, even if you didn't input an answer, so make sure you're submitting the right thing when you do!

        Once you've answered all the knowledge questions, you'll be asked to do some work on a GitHub repo that we provide for you. The slides will let you know whether you've done the right steps or not, but we will also provide you with feedback from a real human in a few days.
