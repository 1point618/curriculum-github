        This assessment will be used to get a sense for how much you learned from the GitHub for Developers class.

        Go through the following slides, answering each question to the best of your ability.

        Once you've answered all the knowledge questions, you'll be asked to do some work on a GitHub repo that we provide for you. The slides will let you know whether you've done the right steps or not, but make sure to get the details right because we'll have people looking over the repos to make sure they're all correct.

        Once you've moved past a question, you will not be able to go back and answer it again, even if you didn't answer it the first time around. 

        Don't move on until you've answered the question!
