        Pulse is a high-level overview of your entire project. Pulse will show you who has been actively committing and what has changed in a project's default branch. Pulse is also a great way to see new and merged pull requests, open and closed issues, and unresolved discussions.

        - do: "Click `Pulse`"
          say: "Pulse is the dashboard for your project. It gives you a high-level overview of the work that has been done and the work that is yet to be completed."
        - do: "Show `Period`"

          say: "As you scroll down the page, you can view a detailed list of the pull requests that have been merged, the pull requests that are still open, the issues that have been closed, and the issues that have been opened. As you reach the bottom of the page, you will also see a section for unresolved conversations. These are issues that were opened outside of the timeframe you have selected and remain open."
        - do: "Click `Graphs`"

          say: "The contribution graph tells you who has added and deleted content from this repository and when they did it."

          say: "You can use the punch card to see when the work happens in your repository."
