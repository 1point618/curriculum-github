        - A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. It is easiest to imagine as a project's folder. However, unlike an ordinary folder on your laptop, a GitHub repository offers simple yet powerful tools for collaborating with others. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Whether you are just curious or you are a major contributor, knowing your way around a repository is essential!

        - do: Navigate to the first sample repository
          say: The repository is the container that holds everything related to your project.
        - do: Click `Code` view
          say: The code view is where you will find the files included the repository. These files may contain the project code, documentations, and other important files. We also call this view the root of the project. Any changes to these files is tracked via Git version control.
        - do: View the `README.md`
          say: The README.md is a special file that we recommend all repositories contain. GitHub looks for this file and helpfully displays it below the repository. It usually explains the project and where to find helpful information within the project.
        - do: Click `Issues` view
          say: Issues are used to track bugs and feature requests for the project. Issues can be assigned to specific team members and are designed to encourage discussion and collaboration.
        - do: Click `Pull Request` view
          say: A Pull Request represents a change, such as adding, modifying, or deleting files, which the author would like to make to the repository. Pull Requests are used to resolve Issues.
