        Now that you've committed files locally, it's time to make sure that your remote repository also reflects those changes. So we'll `push` the files and version history up to GitHub.

          say: "Now that you have made some changes and committed them locally, it is time to push them up to the remote. In this case, our remote is GitHub.com, but this could also be your company's internal instance of GHE."
        - do: Type `git status`
          say: "Let's type git status again to check the status of our repository. You should receive a message stating that the working directory is clean."
        - do: Type `git push`
          say: "To push your changes to the remote you will type git push. Remember that earlier git set up a remote tracking branch to match our local branch with the one on GitHub. Since this has already occured, you simply need to type git push."
        - do: Navigate to the `class repository`
          say: "Now, if you navigate to the class repository, you will see a banner at the top of the page indicating You have recently pushed branches:"
        - do: Click `Compare & pull request`
          say: "Since you made your changes on your branch, GitHub assumes you would like to compare those changes to the master branch. You can simply click Compare & pull request to start a new pull request."
        - do: Create a pull request
          say: "Now you can create a pull request using the same process you learned earlier."

        * Check `git status`: the working directory needs to be clean. If it's not, make sure there isn't anything that you meant to commit!
        * Do `git push`: assuming you set the default push behavior to simple, this will push your changes to the same branch on the remote system.
        * Back in GitHub, you can easily start a new pull request to merge the changes into `master` using the same process you learned earlier.
