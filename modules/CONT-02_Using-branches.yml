        - do: Navigate to the class repo
          say: Earlier you created an issue to create an introduction file. Let's create a branch that you will use to add your file.
        - do: Click the branch dropdown
          say: There are several ways to create a branch. You can create a branch by clicking on the branch dropdown.
        - do: Enter the branch name 'firstname-lastname-intro'
          say: And entering a branch name in the text field.
        - do: Press Enter
          say: "When you press Enter, you are automatically switched to the `firstname-lastname-intro` branch. Now, any changes you make to the files in the repository will be applied to this new branch."
        - do: Go to another repo and then return to the class repo
          say: "However, a word of caution. When you leave the repository and come back, notice that GitHub automatically assumes you want to see the items on the master branch. Let's stay on the `master` for a moment."
