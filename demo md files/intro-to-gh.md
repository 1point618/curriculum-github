# Using GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a place to collaborate on projects online. It's built specificially with software projects in mind, but will work for any project where most of what you're collaborating on are plaintext files.

Underneath GitHub is some software called Git. Git is a Version Control System (VCS) that lets you track changes in your files that you make over time and revert to old versions of those files if you ever need to. Git also makes it easy to let multiple people work on the same file at the same time.

GitHub inherits and extends Git's collaboration functionalityby including certain productivity and communication tools. Issues can track bugs or discuss new features. Pull Requests let you discuss large chunks of changes and easily merge that code into the main codebase. The Pulse and Graphs let you see how the project is progressing and who is doing what work. 

In the following articles, you'll learn more about these features and being to use them yourself.

## The GitHub Workflow

GitHub suggests a specific way of using their features in order to work with teams. This is called The GitHub Workflow, and is as much about a culture of collaboration as it is about using technology. In collaborative projects culture is very important, because that's the human side of how work will actually get done.

The GitHub Workflow is pretty simple. When building something new in the project, this work should be done on a branch, not in the main code base. Once work is ready to be shown to others, you should submit a Pull Request to the main branch. Your teammates should look through your work and give you feedback, and you should take action on that feedback. Once everyone is agreed that the work is completed, you should merge the work into the main branch and delete the branch you were working on.
