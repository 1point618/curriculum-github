# Using GitHub

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a place to collaborate on projects online. It's built specificially with software projects in mind, but will work for any project where most of what you're collaborating on are plaintext files.

Underneath GitHub is some software called Git. Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) that lets you track changes in your files made over time and revert to old versions of those files if you ever need to. Git also makes it easy for multiple people to work on the same file at the same time.

GitHub extends Git's collaboration functionality by including certain productivity and communication tools. Issues can be used to track bugs or discuss new features. Pull Requests let you discuss large chunks of changes and easily merge that code into the main codebase. Pulse and Graphs let you see how the project is progressing and who is doing what work. 

On the next few pages, you'll learn more about these features and begin to use them yourself.

## The GitHub Workflow

The GitHub Workflow is as much about creating a culture of collaboration as it is about using technology. Creating a collaborative culture is very important, because that's the human side of how work will actually get done.

The GitHub Workflow is pretty simple. When making changes or adding a new feature to the project, you will work on a branch. Once you have made a few of the changes, you will submit a Pull Request to show others what you would like to add to the master branch. Your teammates will review your work and give you feedback. Once the work is completed, you will merge the changes into the master branch.

In the next few pages, we'll be learning more about each step in this process and actually practicing it on GitHub. Scroll to the top and click on the "next" button to continue.
