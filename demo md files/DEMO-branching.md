# Branches

In Git, a branch is a working copy of your project. Everything in your project lives on a branch.

By convention, the default branch is called `master`. You should never do work directly on the `master` branch, but instead create another branch and then merge that branch back into `master` once your work is done and reviewed by other people. This way the code in `master` is always working, production-ready code. 

When you create a branch from another, you make a perfect copy of that first branch with a new name. From that point on edits made to one branch _will not_ show up on the other until you merge the branches back together.


## Using Branches Effectively

When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given timeâ€”some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.

Any time you want to start a new chunk of work, you should create a new branch for that work. Most commonly, we talk about "feature branches" and "bugfix branches". Technically, there is nothing different about these kinds of branches, it's just a social convention for why you're using them. 

All the work done on one branch should be towards a singular goal. You don't want each person to have a branch with whatever they're working on, or branches that try to both fix bugs and build new features. You want clean, single-purpose branches that can easily and cleanly be merged later.


## Try it Out

In this and the next two articles, we're going to be walking you through the GitHub Workflow. You're going to start by creating a branch to do the rest of the work on.

On the right side of the nav bar above, there is a link called `Repository`. If you click on it, you'll be brought to a GitHub repo that we created for you. From there, you can follow the instructions below. We'll validate certain steps as you go so you know you're doing it right.

* Click on the `Repository` link.
* Look around. This is the Code Veiw, where all your code in the repo is stored. 
* In the upper right, click on the button that says `branch: master`. This is where you can create new branches, or switch from the branch you're on to another branch.
* Create a branch called `create-bio`.
* You'll do the work in the next two lessons on this branch.
