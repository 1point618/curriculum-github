# The GitHub Flow

We've got a bad bug that needs fixing, so we're going to show you how to do that using the GitHub Workflow. You'll learn how to do some new things on GitHub, and afterwards we'll go over _why_ you did it that way. But for now, just follow our instructions. :smiley:

In GitHub, all our code lives in a Repository, or "repo". You can find the name of the repository that you're in at the top of the page. We've created a repo for you. There is a link to it at the top of the page. That where you'll make these changes. 

The `README.md` file is a file that sits in the main directory of a repo. It's another way we use to communicate with each other. The `README.md` file should include everything we need to get the repo running on our local computers. 

I've included the text we want in the README below. Add the text to the README file, commit it to a new branch called `readme-bugfix` (**this is very important!**), then submit a pull request for the changes.
